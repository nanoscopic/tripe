# Tripe
An attempt to organize the varieties of tripe that are commonly present within social media.

## Blind link

Posting of a single link, either already URL shortened, or shortened by the social network it is posted to, such that you have no idea what it is and have no motivation to click on it.

## Connect-a-thon

"This post is a party for everyone who reads it to connect to each other"

## Rich person did X, you should too!

A single anecdote is not much evidence of anything. Unless it is a reasonably scientific study of a wide number of people ruling out other effects most of this is nonsense and won't improve your ability to "get rich".

## Popular News

Examples:
- "X got fired! X got re-hired!"
- "X died"

This stuff is certainly news, but having all of your connections each post the same bit of popular news makes it pointless. If you are going to post something that is the same old shit, at least talk about it from your own viewpoint and contribute something to the conversation.

## TIL ( Today I learned )

This is useless information disguised as a helpful sharing of some useful learning. Often it is an oversimplification of actual truth and looks like someone copied and pasted the first few paragraphs of an introduction to some topic.

## False Shortcuts

Examples:
- "This is how to pass a FAANG interview"
- "You don't need college/university. Just take this online course."

## Hustle Junk

Anything promoting extreme hard work as the key to having riches, success, fame, etc in life. The reality is that hard work doesn't guarantee any of this, and that it is better to have a balanaced and sustainable lifestyle than attempting to overwork yourself to success.

## Useless quotes

Posting a quote, that, while potentially interesting, might as well be a random quote pulled from a random book of quotes and posted for no reason whatsoever. Quotes are interesting sure, but spamming people you know with them is just annoying and pointless. If you are going to post a quote, say something yourself about it, and something more than "hey look I like this quote."

## FUD ( Fear, Uncertainy, and Doubt )

These are things that are shared that exaggerate fear or promote a misunderstanding of things that are actually well understood. This exaggeration may be intentional or unintentional. The author knowing that what they are posting is FUD is not necessary for it to be such.

1. Accessing websites is unsafe

The post or argument explains that using the internet in a standard fashion is risky and will likely result in your being "hacked". Often there is some technical argument and the post is disguised as a PSA to make you aware that some specific way of accessing the internet is unsafe.

Examples:
- "Using public wifi is unsafe"
- "Following shortened URLs is dangerous"
- "Visiting shady websites is unsafe"

2. "LLMs are taking our jobs"

## X Should be Illegal

1. "LLMs are stealing our content"

This one is interesting because LLMs do in fact ignore Copyright notices and ingest content in a way that many reasonable people view these systems as whitewashing Copyright theft. The common claim is that what is being done is illegal, when this is rarely if ever true.

The reason for these posts clearly seems to be that there is a gap in current law. It remains to be seen whether what is currently done will become illegal or not.

## Term Misapplication

1. "X is a Pedo"

Pedophilia is generally defined as a sexual attraction / interest in prepubescent children. This is rarely the way this term is applied. The majority of the people being accused of being a pedo are actually hebephiles, which is being attracted to young children that have already reached puberty. Because hebephilia is viewed as nearly just as bad, this distinction is discarded and the inaccurate term continues to be applied.

Additionally, the term is often applied as meaning "you abuse children". It does not generally mean that. Pedophilia is the attraction / interest, not the action of abuse. This misapplication is justified with phrases such as "but they are likely to abuse children", or "but they will abuse children if given the chance". Such lines of logic are equivalent to thought crime, the idea that thinking or wanting something is equivalent to actually engaging in an action.
